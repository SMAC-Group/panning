# panning
An implementation of the Panning Algorithm.

Prior to installing the `panning` R package with `devtools`, please make sure to have a compiler installed on your system that is compatible with R.

If you have a compiler already installed, then continue on by installing the package dependencies and finally the package itself by doing the following: 

```r
# Install dependencies
install.packages(c("devtools","doParallel","doRNG","nnet"))

# Install the package from github
devtools::install_github("SMAC-Group/panning")
```
